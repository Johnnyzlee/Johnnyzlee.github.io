Welcome! I am currently a final year master student in the [https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2017/0313/c3902a31615/page.htm Network Intelligence Center (NICE)] 
at [https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn ShanghaiTech University], Shanghai, China, 
where I received my B.Eng. degree in computer science with honor in 2021. My advisor is [https://shiyuanming.github.io/ Prof. Yuanming Shi].\n 

Starting from Fall 2024, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [https://eekhaled.home.ece.ust.hk/ Prof. Khaled B. Letaief] in the [https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/ Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE)], Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong SAR, China.\n

I am interested in understanding, utilizing and developing elegant theoretical tools as well as provable learning-based methods to direct the design of and optimize the performance of the next generation communication networks. 
My particular focus lies in applying graph theory, discrete algorithms, and mathematical optimization for federated edge learning, computing power network and non-terrestrial networks in 5G/6G.\n
